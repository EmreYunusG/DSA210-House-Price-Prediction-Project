# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using publicly available data from Kaggle. The objective is to apply data science methodologies, including data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling, to generate accurate price predictions.

## Motivation
House prices are influenced by various factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and market trends. Predicting house prices accurately can be beneficial for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors. This project will help in understanding the key features affecting house prices and improving predictive models for better decision-making.

## Data Source
- **Primary Dataset**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing historical house sale prices along with relevant features.
- **Additional Data**: To enrich the dataset, external sources such as economic indicators, inflation rates, or geographical features may be incorporated.

## Data Processing & Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing outliers
   - Standardizing formats
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizing trends and patterns
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical variables
4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Comparing different machine learning models
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Performance evaluation using metrics such as RMSE

## Findings
- Key factors influencing house prices
- Model performance insights
- Unexpected correlations or patterns in the data

## Limitations & Future Work
- **Limitations**
  - Potential bias in the dataset
  - Limited external factors considered
- **Future Work**
  - Incorporating more features (e.g., interest rates, neighborhood crime rates)
  - Using deep learning models for improved accuracy
