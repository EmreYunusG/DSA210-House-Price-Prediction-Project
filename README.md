## House Price Comparison: London vs. Istanbul

### Project Overview
This project aims to compare house prices in two distinct locations: London (United Kingdom) and Istanbul (Turkey). By analyzing various factors influencing real estate prices, we seek to uncover trends and differences between these two markets.

### Data Sources
- **London House Prices**: Publicly available datasets from Kaggle and government sources.
- **Istanbul House Prices**: Data collected from local real estate listings and open sources.
- **Additional Data for Enrichment**:
  - Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, interest rates)
  - Crime rates
  - Population density
  - Average income levels

### Methods
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and handling missing data
   - Standardizing formats for consistency
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new attributes (e.g., price per square meter, age of property)
   - Enriching datasets with external economic and social factors
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing price distributions
   - Comparing key metrics across locations
4. **Statistical Analysis & Modeling**
   - Identifying significant price drivers
   - Evaluating correlations between different factors

### Expected Outcomes
- A detailed comparison of house price trends between London and Istanbul
- Insights into factors influencing real estate pricing in each location
- Potential recommendations for buyers and investors

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization libraries (Plotly, Folium for geospatial analysis)

### Next Steps
- Finalize dataset selection and preprocessing
- Perform initial data analysis and visualization
- Develop predictive models to analyze price determinants
