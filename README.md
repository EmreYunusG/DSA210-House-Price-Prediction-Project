## House Price Comparison: London vs. Istanbul

### Project Overview
This project aims to compare house prices in two distinct locations: London (United Kingdom) and Istanbul (Turkey). By analyzing various factors influencing real estate prices, I seek to uncover trends and differences between these two markets.

### Data Sources
I collected both data from Kaggle, and I will select the close dates for each data to cancel the effect of global inflation.
- **London House Prices**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jakewright/house-price-data
- **Istanbul House Prices**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aselasel/house-price-dataset


### Methods
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and handling missing data
   - Standardizing formats for consistency
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new attributes (e.g., price per square meter, age of property)
   - Enriching datasets with external economic and social factors
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing price distributions
   - Comparing key metrics across locations
4. **Statistical Analysis & Modeling**
   - Identifying significant price drivers
   - Evaluating correlations between different factors

### Expected Outcomes
- A detailed comparison of house price trends between London and Istanbul
- Insights into factors influencing real estate pricing in each location
- Potential recommendations for buyers and investors

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

  
### Limitations and Future Work
#### Limitations
- Data availability and quality may vary between the two cities, leading to inconsistencies.
- Some external factors (e.g., government policies, historical trends, zoning laws) are not accounted for in the analysis.
- The dataset may not fully capture seasonal fluctuations and emerging trends in the housing market.


- #### Future Work
- Expanding the dataset to include more historical data for trend analysis.
- Conducting deeper regional analysis within each city to compare different districts and their pricing dynamics.
